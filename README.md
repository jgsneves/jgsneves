### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, my name is JoÃ£o Neves and I'm a Brazilian fullstack developer. I've been a lawyer since 2014 and a frontend developer since 2020. After a while feeling frustrated about my lawyer career, I started to open my mind to other opportunities. I had some experiences on creating web sites and programming with C++ in my teens (back in 2004) and I remembered it fondly, so after some pondering it became clear to me that I should pursue this as a career. So, back in 2019 I went back into coding, started a bachelor's in System Analysis And Development and decided that it got to be my career. After that, I started to work with JavaScript, Typescript and React for some companies. I love to develop frontend applications but I realized that I'm hungry to be part of business rules and details - I want to know more about the business product and how to achieve company goals - so I started to study C# and .NET to become a fullstack developer.
