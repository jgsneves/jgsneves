### Hi there 👋

Hello, my name is João Neves, and I am a Brazilian fullstack developer. I started my career as a developer in 2020, working initially as a frontend developer. Since then, I have been involved in various projects using ReactJS, Redux, NextJS, and Typescript. 

This includes the creation of a fintech that assists physical retail companies in accepting the instant payment method PIX. Additionally, I worked on developing a web application for remotely controlling a maintenance robot for electricity distribution stations. 

I also contributed to the Casas Bahia shopping cart (https://www.casasbahia.com.br/), the fourth-largest e-commerce platform in Brazil.

Recognizing the need to understand more about the business rules in which I am involved, I expanded my expertise to backend technologies, particularly NodeJS and .NET (C#).
