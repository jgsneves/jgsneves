### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, my name is JoÃ£o Neves and I'm a Brazilian front-end developer. I've been a lawyer since 2014 and a frontend developer since 2020. After a while feeling frustrated about my lawyer career, I started to open my mind to other opportunities. I had some experiences on creating web sites and programming with C++ in my teens and I remembered it fondly, so after some pondering it became clear to me that I should pursue this as a career. So, back in 2019 I went back into coding and started a bachelor's in System Analysis And Development.
